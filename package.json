    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Optimize OnPerformCulling by computing the CullingSplits from a main thread Burst job.\n* EntitiesGraphicsSystem.GetMesh and EntitiesGraphicsSystem.GetMaterial are now public.\n* Warning in-editor when using Entities.Graphics and URP that Forward+ rendering path should be used.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Removed async readback from deformations and replaced with fixed number of frames.\n* The built-in properties for URP has been changed so that they have a slider for most values between 0-1. Relevant properties have also been changed from using a float4 for color in the inspector to use a color property instead.\n* `PushBlendWeightSystem.cs`, `PushSkinMatrixSystem.cs`, `MeshRendererBaking.cs` script files have been updated to the latest idiomatic `foreach()`.\n* Changed skin matrix / blend shape weight access in CopyBlendShapeWeightsToGPUJob and CopySkinMatricesToGPUJob to readonly.\n* Improved `SkinnedMeshRenderer` baking performance\n* Updated com.unity.render-pipelines.core dependency from 14.0.4 to 14.0.6\n\n### Removed\n\n * Removed RemapMaterialMeshIndexJob. Both array indices and runtime IDs are now directly supported for MaterialMeshInfo.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Occlusion browser not being updated properly in play mode.\n* Only call UpdateAllBatches if there are entities graphics chunks\n* Fixed a bug with Baked Lights inside subscenes, where the bakingOutput of such Lights was not updated correctly.\n* Fixed global ambient probe when multiple cameras are present with HDRP\n* Light baking will cause the MeshRenderers to bake, thus automatically updating the light map in the entities scene. This previously required forcing the reimport of the entity scene.\n* 'GraphicsDeviceType.OpenGLES2' is obsolete: 'OpenGL ES 2.0 is no longer supported in Unity 2023.1'"
